"""
Comprehensive equivalence testing suite for ColorCode refactoring.

This module provides systematic testing of functional equivalence between
the legacy ColorCode implementation and the refactored modular implementation.

Test Structure:
- Phase 1: Circuit generation equivalence 
- Phase 2: Tanner graph construction equivalence
- Phase 3: DEM generation equivalence (future)
- Phase 4: Decoder equivalence (future)
- Phase 5: Simulation equivalence (future)
- Integration: End-to-end equivalence testing
